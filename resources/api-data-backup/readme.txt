I made this in case the api will no longer be available - i can just change it so the project uses the local data and it will still work.

Welcome to the HP-API!
This API isn't currently being updated, but I hope you find it useful for your coding projects.

Use these routes to request data on Harry Potter characters:

http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters - view all characters
http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters/students - view all characters who are Hogwarts students during the book series
http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters/staff - view all characters who are Hogwarts staff during the book series
http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters/house/:house - view all characters in a certain house, e.g. /slytherin
No API key is required.
