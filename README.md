Getting back into Laravel. Small, interesting application.

Don't just read my code, i recommend you run it(i mean, it looks cool).


INSTRUCTIONS: open your git bash(or whatever terminal you're using), navigate to the project folder and run:  
-composer install  
-cp .env.example .env  
-php artisan cache:clear  
-composer dump-autoload  
-php artisan serve
